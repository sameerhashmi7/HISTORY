              <p class="text-center" > <h3 class="fw-bolder">Allama Muhammad Iqbal,</h3> born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, British India (now in Pakistan), was a philosopher, poet, and politician whose profound influence on the intellectual and political landscape of South Asia earned him the title of "Mufakkir-e-Pakistan" (The Thinker of Pakistan). Iqbal's life was marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a deep commitment to the betterment of his people. He studied in Europe, earning degrees from Cambridge and Munich, and emerged as a prominent advocate for the rights and upliftment of Muslims in British India.

              <p>
                Iqbal played a pivotal role in inspiring the vision of an independent Muslim state, which ultimately led to the creation of Pakistan in 1947. His poetic works, written in both Persian and Urdu, served as a catalyst for the awakening of the Muslim identity and the quest for self-determination. In his famous poem "Lab Pe Aati Hai Dua Ban Ke Tamanna Meri" (My Heart's Desire Is Voiced As A Prayer), Iqbal beautifully encapsulates the dreams and aspirations of a nation. His poetry not only celebrated the richness of the Islamic heritage but also urged Muslims to rise above their circumstances and strive for excellence.

            <div class="col col col-12 col-lg-12 col-sm-12 text-white"data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-duration="1500"><p>One of Iqbal's most renowned poems is "Tarana-e-Milli" (Anthem of the Community), where he articulates the collective spirit and resilience of the Muslim ummah. The powerful verses of "Khudi Ko Kar Buland Itna" (Elevate Thyself) implore individuals to cultivate selfhood and strive for self-improvement, emphasizing the importance of personal empowerment for societal progress. Throughout his literary journey, Iqbal consistently emphasized the values of justice, equality, and spiritual enlightenment.</p>
            <p>
              Allama Iqbal's legacy extends beyond his literary contributions; his philosophical ideas laid the groundwork for the ideological foundation of Pakistan. His vision of a separate Muslim state, where individuals could practice their faith freely and contribute to the progress of society, became a reality in the form of Pakistan. Today, Allama Iqbal is remembered not only as a poet and philosopher but as a guiding force whose ideas continue to shape the cultural and intellectual identity of Pakistan.
            </p>
          <p>Iqbal's impact on the political landscape of British India was not confined to his poetic expressions alone; he actively engaged in political activism. He served as the president of the All-India Muslim League in 1930, advocating for the rights of Muslims and envisioning a state where they could live in accordance with their cultural and religious values. Iqbal's address at the Allahabad session in 1930, commonly known as the "Allahabad Address," is often considered a precursor to the idea of a separate Muslim state.</p>
        <p>In addition to his political endeavors, Iqbal contributed significantly to the realm of philosophy. His philosophical thoughts, particularly those outlined in works like "The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam," emphasized the need for a dynamic reinterpretation of Islamic principles to address the challenges of the modern world. Iqbal argued for a synthesis of traditional Islamic teachings with the advancements of contemporary knowledge, encouraging Muslims to engage with science, philosophy, and social sciences while staying true to their faith.</p>
      <p>The themes of Iqbal's poetry are diverse, ranging from the beauty of nature to the complexities of human existence. His "Bang-e-Dra" (The Call of the Marching Bell) and "Zarb-i Kalim" (The Reed-Pen) are monumental collections that reflect the multifaceted dimensions of his poetic genius. "Shikwa" (Complaint) and "Jawab-e-Shikwa" (Response to the Complaint) stand out as masterpieces where Iqbal engages in a poetic dialogue with the Almighty, questioning the state of the Muslim world and expressing a yearning for redemption.</p>
      <p class="text-center">Allama Iqbal's enduring legacy is not only evident in the creation of Pakistan but also in the hearts and minds of its people. His poetry continues to resonate with individuals, inspiring them to strive for intellectual, spiritual, and societal upliftment. The spirit of Iqbal lives on in the cultural fabric of Pakistan, reminding its citizens of the values that underpin the nation's foundation and the ongoing journey towards a just and enlightened society</p></div>
